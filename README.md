Hi Whisbi team!
Thanks for giving me the chance to take a shot with this challenge.

I've been using frameworls (vue + react) for a while now, so it was good to back to vanilla to remeber how that all works without any helpers.

What I would have done next (if i'd had more time):

- Made the design a lot more interesting and cooler! Its wite basic as-s.

- Added autoprefixer to build process so it looks nice all over the web.

- Gone through and made it reposive in amore organised a nd thorough way.

- Looked into firther optimising my images and creating a wider breadth for srcset.

- And tidied my code more!!


Looking forward to your feedback :)
