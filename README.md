Hi team!
Thanks for giving me the chance to take a shot with this challenge.

I've been using frameworks (vue + react) for a while now, so it was good to back to vanilla to remember how that all works without any helpers.

What I would have done next (if i'd had more time):

- Added autoprefixer to build process so it looks nice all over the web.

- Gone through and made it resposive in a more organised and thorough way.

- Looked into further optimising my images and creating a wider breadth for srcset.

- Sorted the returned data in a sensible way (last commit or some such).

- Tidied my code more, and refractored much more.

- Made the design a lot more interesting and cooler! Its quite basic as-is.
  ( FYI if you want to see the landing pages im currently building for a local company (note this is a WIP so there are a few bugs youll see... just to get the idea of my aestheic ) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zDrDWItqf2PZXu-kQpCnbZ__bnzZ1Yk1?usp=sharing) )


Looking forward to your feedback :)
